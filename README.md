# ABUELA

ABUELA is a LaTeX integrated development environment which attempts to solve all the painful problems with common LaTeX editors. ABUELA achieves this by including a live preview, command predictor, auto save, and many more features and tools in its advanced software.

## Installation

If you have Python installed, you can run a much faster version of the editor by downloading the requisites using the following command:

```batch
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After that, execute the `main.py` file.

If you don't have Python installed on your computer, you can simply run the executable file located in the `bin` folder.

As of the latest version, you will need to install the LaTeX environment to be able to run the software. You can get a version of said LaTeX environment [here](https://miktex.org/download).
